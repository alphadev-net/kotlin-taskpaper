A library that allows easy parsing and writing of [TaskPaper](https://guide.taskpaper.com/getting-started/) files.

# Usage

This lib currently focuses on interoperability with OmniFocus, but strives for general compatibility with the TaskPaper format. There is no Tool to process TaskPaper files, only the lib to be integrated into other Kotlin code.

# Bugs and Issues

If you encounter an (somewhat valid) TaskPaper file that this lib fails to process but you think it should anyway, please don't hesitate to file an issue.
